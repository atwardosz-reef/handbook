# What is this about

When you join the company, we need to bring you up to our level (or maybe you need to bring us to your level ;) ). Best way we found to do that, is to show you some video / text material, so here it is. Bill the time spent doing this on `RT / training`, put the title of the movie/article into the work subject note.

You don't need to see all of it in one go. Instead, use it to tune the speed of your initial transition into the project. If the transition is quick (you are heavily coding on your first day), slow it down and watch some training material every day. If the transition is slow due to questions, timezones, environment issues and other blocking issues, then report those and watch some training material.

You are expected to see everything that matches your position within two weeks from starting the work with the company.

 - http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/ - why you should never, ever, ever use MongoDB. NOTE: read that until you are sure you will never use it. If you are still not convinced after reading it, read [this](https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2013/05/13/mongo-bad-for-scraped-data/), if you are still not convinced, try [this](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/comment-page-1/) and if you still are not entirely sure, you might want to know that their "atomic" property actually makes it so that if you have a collection with some objects and you'll query to get 1000 objects based on some criteria during an update operation, you will sometimes get 999 back. And that is by design, they closed the bug as "won't fix". So if you ask mongodb for something, you have to check if it returned what you asked for, because if it didn't, then you need to retry and *if you are lucky* then eventually you'll get what you asked for. Not everyone likes to write code like that and most people want to have access to their data always, not just when it's their lucky day. And also [this](https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/04/bitcoin-banking-mongodb/).

Why pathlib is fun:
